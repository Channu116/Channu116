Hey there! I'm Channaveer m, an aspiring Data Scientist passionate about leveraging data to derive insights and solve complex problems. Welcome to my GitHub profile, where you'll find a glimpse of my projects and contributions in the field of Data Science, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence.

## About Me
📚 Currently, I'm learning about Large Language Models (LLMs) and exploring their applications in natural language processing (NLP) tasks.

👨‍💻 I'm proficient in Python, MySQL, Power BI.

🔬 My areas of expertise include Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Data Visualization.

📊 I enjoy working on diverse projects ranging from HR data analysis dashboards to predictive analytics for healthcare and agriculture.

## Projects
Here are a few notable projects I've worked on:

## 1.Sales Effectiveness: [Python |Matplotlib | Seaborn | TensorFlow | Keras | CNN]                                  
     Client: Sales Effectiveness | Category : Product Sale 
     Project Description: 
•	The purpose of this project is to understand the relationship of each variable with outcome variable using graphs and generate useful information for the client. 
•	Spearheaded machine learning modelling and evaluation, achieving a remarkable 73.80% accuracy with XGBoost 
•	Elevated lead categorization, directly contributing to a significant 15% enhancement in sales performance for FicZon Inc
  
  ## 2.Handwritten digit recognition : – [Python | Pandas | Matplotlib |Seaborn | ML | CNN]                     
       Project Description: 
•	Built a convolutional neural network (CNN) using TensorFlow and Keras to classify handwritten digits (0–9) on the MNIST dataset.
•	Enhanced input data with normalization and resizing, improving model convergence and training stability.
•	Designed a custom multi-layer architecture with convolutional, max-pooling, and dropout layers to optimize feature learning and mitigate overfitting.
•	Conducted extensive hyperparameter tuning—experimenting with learning rates, optimizers, and dropout percentages—to maximize performance.
•	Achieved 99.32% accuracy on the held-out test set, well above baseline benchmarks for the problem.

## 3.Ranking of FIFA-20 Players : - [Python |NumPy | Pandas | Matplotlib | Seaborn | Machine Learning]      
    Project Description:
•	Applied K Means and Hierarchical Clustering to FIFA 20 player attributes (e.g., shooting, passing, defence) to reveal distinct player archetypes—such as forwards, midfielders, defenders, and goalkeepers .
•	Performed feature scaling and dimensionality reduction (PCA) to enhance cluster separation and interpretability 
•	Designed a composite ranking system by integrating performance metrics with cluster-based archetype insights to support data-driven team-building and tactical decision-making.
•	Skills: Unsupervised Learning · Clustering · Feature Engineering · PCA · Data Visualization · Model Interpretation
